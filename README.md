# TB_Analysis

**Tuberculosis Dataset Analysis**

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on a tuberculosis dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project was undertaken as part of a learning task assigned by my mentor. It involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, followed by basic statistical exploration to understand the data better.

📊 **Dataset**

The dataset includes medical and demographic features potentially associated with tuberculosis, such as imaging data and patient information.

🧹 **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

The following steps were performed:

Missing value handling: Not found.

Data type conversions: Ensured correct data types for all columns (e.g., categorical encoding).

📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Performed basic statistical analysis including:

Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

Distribution plots for numerical features

Correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables

🛠 **Tools Used**

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

📁 **Files**

📋 Tuberculosis_cleaned dataset.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire codebase for the project.

📋 tuberculosis_xray_dataset.csv: Raw dataset from **Kaggle**.
